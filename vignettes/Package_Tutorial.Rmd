# This is the tutorial file for my R Package. 

You might have already seen the introduction section of the website. It has a hint on what the data looks like. 
So let's get started by downloading the simulated data set and the empirical data set. These data contain the summary statistics of the simulated and empirical data generated by a Bayesian phylogenetic software called `RevBayes`. 

I will be updating the tutorial file soon...............
